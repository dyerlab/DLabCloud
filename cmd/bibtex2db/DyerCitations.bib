Abstract = {Gene flow in animals is limited or facilitated by different features
   within the landscape matrix they inhabit. The landscape representation
   in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance
   surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for
   assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also,
   desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We
   addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the
   effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the
   desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity
   and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and
   movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents,
   generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based
   on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these
   variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and
   structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by
   first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic
   inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface
   (NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of
   individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity.
   Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed
   that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs.
   categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization
   framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation
   cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami's
   functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could
   further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity
   observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between
   environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami's behavior and
   physiology.},

Abstract = {As urbanization drastically alters the natural landscape and generates
   novel habitats within cities, the potential for changes to gene flow for
   urban-dwelling species increases. The western black widow spider
   (Latrodectus hesperus) is a medically relevant urban adapter pest
   species, for which we have previously identified population genetic
   signatures consistent with urbanization facilitating gene flow, likely
   due to human-mediated transport. Here, in an analysis of 1.9 million
   genome-wide SNPs, we contrast broad-scale geographical analyses of 10
   urban and 11 non-urban locales with fine-scale within-city analyses
   including 30 urban locales across the western USA. These hierarchical
   datasets enable us to test hypotheses of how urbanization impacts
   multiple urban cities and their genetic connectivity at different
   spatial scales. Coupled fine-scale and broad-scale analyses reveal
   contrasting patterns of high and low genetic differentiation among
   locales within cities as a result of low and high genetic connectivity,
   respectively, of these cities to the overall population network. We
   discuss these results as they challenge the use of cities as replicates
   of urban eco-evolution, and have implications for conservation and human
   health in a rapidly growing urban habitat.},

Title = {Urbanization as a facilitator of gene flow in a human health pest},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3219-3230},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations,
   reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all
   of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene
   flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an
   urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to
   thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated
   transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic
   approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic
   connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model
   of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide
   polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD
   (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban
   and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United
   States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic,
   and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population
   genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and
   higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show
   that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs
   that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of
   historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban
   facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of
   sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that
   urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape
   continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors
   influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black
   widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.},

Title = {Structure and Resilience of Bald Eagle Roost Networks},
Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-203},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The recognition that communal roosts are important elements within the
   life cycle of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) led to their
   protection under the ``disturb{''} clause of the Bald and Golden Eagle
   Protection Act. The regular roost-switching movements of bald eagles
   imply that roosts are part of an interactive network where roosts
   represent nodes linked by birds moving between them. Network analysis
   holds promise for informing management decisions by assessing the effect
   of roost removal on the resilience of the broader network. We tracked
   nonbreeding bald eagles (n = 56) within the upper Chesapeake Bay
   (2008-2013), USA, to evaluate roost characteristics and network
   structure. We used midnight locations (n = 14,464) to assess the use of
   communal roosts (n = 212) and movement of birds among roosts (n = 2,634)
   on successive roost nights to evaluate the pattern and strength of
   connections. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the response
   of the roost network to roost loss. Structure of the roost network
   approximated that of a scale-free network where the distribution of
   connections follows a power law of the form P(k)=Ak(-gamma) and gamma =
   1.1. Unlike random networks, connections within scale-free networks are
   concentrated within a few highly connected nodes (hubs). These hub
   roosts serve as bridges between large numbers of other roosts, have the
   shortest travel times to other roosts and greatest overall influence on
   network functioning. The effect of roost removal on overall network
   function was directly proportional to the connectivity of the roost
   being removed. The targeted removal of the majority (>90\%) of roosts
   had very little effect on the network. Network sensitivity was high in
   response to the loss of roosts within the highest 10\% of connectivity.
   This small (n = 18) subset of roosts makes a disproportionate
   contribution to network function and the protection of these roosts
   should be a stated management objective with high priority. Network
   analysis represents a powerful tool with the potential to inform
   management decisions. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

Abstract = {Sex-specific genetic structure is a commonly observed pattern among
   vertebrate species. Facing differential selective pressures, individuals
   may adopt sex-specific life history traits that ultimately shape genetic
   variation among populations. Although differential dispersal dynamics
   are commonly detected in the literature, few studies have used genetic
   structure to investigate sex-specific functional connectivity. The
   recent use of graph theoretic approaches in landscape genetics has
   demonstrated network capacities to describe complex system behaviours
   where network topology represents genetic interaction among subunits.
   Here, we partition the overall genetic structure into sex-specific
   graphs, revealing different male and female dispersal dynamics of a
   fisher (Pekania {[}Martes] pennanti) metapopulation in southern Ontario.
   Our analyses based on network topologies supported the hypothesis of
   male-biased dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effect of
   the landscape, identified at the population level, could be partitioned
   among sex-specific strata. We found that female connectivity was
   negatively correlated with snow depth, whereas connectivity among males
   was not. Our findings underscore the potential of conducting
   sex-specific analysis by identifying landscape elements or configuration
   that differentially promotes or impedes functional connectivity between
   sexes, revealing processes that may otherwise remain cryptic. We propose
   that the sex-specific graph approach would be applicable to other vagile
   species where differential sex-specific processes are expected to occur.},

   population of Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) breeding in
   nest boxes, demonstrate associated fitness costs, and investigate
   parasite strategy. We genotyped individuals at 6 microsatellite loci and
   used Cervus software to determine log-likelihood of maternity (LOD
   scores) for offspring and social mothers. We set critical cutoff LOD
   scores at 95\% confidence for exclusion of the social mother and
   assignment of a parasite mother from the breeding population. Of 805
   nestlings (233 family groups during 2009-2013), we found that 12.7\% had
   genotypes that were incompatible with their social mother. Females with
   unrelated nestlings (hosts) fledged fewer biological offspring within
   the host year than nonhost females despite fledging more total
   offspring, but being a host was not significantly associated with total
   reproductive success over 5 yr of breeding. We were able to identify
   only similar to 30\% of parasite females, which suggests that the
   majority of parasites may be floaters (i.e. non-nesters) in the
   population or nesting in nearby natural cavities. We found no evidence
   of host selection based on host age, arrival at the breeding site, or
   nest-box productivity in the previous year. This opportunistic behavior
   is likely facilitated by the nesting ecology of this population, in that
   nest sites are limited, conspicuous, and relatively dense. Future
   studies investigating CBP in populations using natural cavities can help
   elucidate the drivers of this behavior.},

Abstract = {Mountains as natural barriers often have important effects on
   intraspecific genetic structure through restraining gene flow and
   enhancing differentiation among populations. While the Qinling and Daba
   mountains are considered significant geographic barriers, dividing China
   into temperate and subtropical regions, little is known about how this
   barrier influences the genetic patterns of sister species represented in
   distinct habitats. In this study, we analyzed genetic differentiation
   and the geographic boundary between Pinus henryi and Pinus tabuliformis
   using chloroplast microsatellite markers. Our data show high levels of
   among-population differentiation, consistent with the effects of
   historical demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and climate
   effects. Three main geographic boundaries coinciding with mountain
   systems indicate natural landscapes, such as large rivers, and habitat
   loss caused by anthropogenic deforestation, are significant barriers to
   genetic exchange among populations. The divergence between populations
   in the eastern and western Qinling Mountains populations may possibly be
   ascribed to fragmentation driven by climate change. The genetic boundary
   of P. henryi and P. tabuliformis generally coincides with the previous
   morphological dividing line based on the unweighted pair group method
   using arithmetic averages and on spatial analysis of molecular variance.

Abstract = {For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary, it must satisfy two
   conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing
   disciplines, and it must be able to provide insights, through this
   interaction, that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this
   study, I examine the complete body of peer-reviewed literature
   self-identified as landscape genetics (LG) using the statistical
   approaches of text mining and natural language processing. The goal here
   was to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in LG studies,
   the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they
   are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology
   and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within
   published LG studies examining the extent to which emergent questions
   are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing
   individual- and population-based approaches. I close by providing some
   suggestions on where theoretical and analytical work is needed if LGs is
   to serve as a real bridge connecting evolution and ecology sensu lato.},

Abstract = {Reticulitermes termites play key roles in dead wood decomposition and
   nutrient cycling in forests. They also damage man-made structures,
   resulting in considerable economic loss. In the eastern United States,
   five species (R. flavipes, R. virginicus, R. nelsonae, R. hageni and R.
   malletei) have overlapping ranges and are difficult to distinguish
   morphologically. Here we present a molecular tool for species
   identification. It is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   amplification of a section of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
   subunit II gene, followed by a three-enzyme restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) assay, with banding patterns resolved via agarose
   gel electrophoresis. The assay was designed using a large set of
   training data obtained from a public DNA sequence database, then
   evaluated using an independent test panel of Reticulitermes from the
   Southern Appalachian Mountains, for which species assignments were
   determined via phylogenetic comparison to reference sequences. After
   refining the interpretive framework, the PCR-RFLP assay was shown to
   provide accurate identification of four co-occurring species (the fifth
   species, R. hageni, was absent from the test panel, so accuracy cannot
   yet be extended to training data). The assay is cost- and
   time-efficient, and will help improve knowledge of Reticulitermes
   species distributions.},

   adopted an increasingly sophisticated set of techniques to quantify
   intervening physical and ecological spaces, although they are restrained
   by rather mundane approaches to characterizing the genetic components of
   connectivity. Population Graphs are one approach to improving the
   quantification of genetic covariance used in models of landscape

   explain its strengths and weaknesses, and provide examples of how it has

Abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow is a major driver of spatial genetic structure
   in plant populations. Both individual plant characteristics and
   site-specific features of the landscape can modify the perceived
   attractiveness of plants to their pollinators and thus play an important
   role in shaping spatial genetic variation. Most studies of
   landscape-level genetic connectivity in plants have focused on the
   effects of interindividual distance using spatial and increasingly
   ecological separation, yet have not incorporated individual plant
   characteristics or other at-site ecological variables. Using spatially
   explicit simulations, we first tested the extent to which the inclusion
   of at-site variables influencing local pollination success improved the
   statistical characterization of genetic connectivity based upon
   examination of pollen pool genetic structure. The addition of at-site
   characteristics provided better models than those that only considered
   interindividual spatial distance (e.g. IBD). Models parameterized using
   conditional genetic covariance (e.g. population graphs) also
   outperformed those assuming panmixia. In a natural population of Cornus
   florida L. (Cornaceae), we showed that the addition of at-site
   characteristics (clumping of primary canopy opening above each maternal
   tree and maternal tree floral output) provided significantly better
   models describing gene flow than models including only between-site
   spatial (IBD) and ecological (isolation by resistance) variables.
   Overall, our results show that including interindividual and local
   ecological variation greatly aids in characterizing landscape-level
   measures of contemporary gene flow.},

Abstract = {The Forest ecosystem genomics Research: supporTing Transatlantic
   Cooperation project (FoResTTraC, http://www.foresttrac.eu/) sponsored a
   workshop in August 2010 to evaluate the potential for using a landscape

   the potential of local populations for coping with changing climate.
   This paper summarizes our discussions and articulates a vision of how we
   believe forest trees offer an unparalleled opportunity to address
   fundamental biological questions, as well as how the application of
   landscape genomic methods complement to traditional forest genetic
   approaches that provide critical information needed for natural resource
   management. In this paper, we will cover four topics. First, we begin by
   defining landscape genomics and briefly reviewing the unique situation
   for tree species in the application of this approach toward
   understanding plant adaptation to the environment. Second, we review
   traditional approaches in forest genetics for studying local adaptation
   and identifying loci underlying locally adapted phenotypes. Third, we
   present existing and emerging methods available for landscape genomic
   analyses. Finally, we briefly touch on how these approaches can aid in
   understanding practical topics such as management of tree populations

Abstract = {Ecologically interacting species may have phylogeographical histories
   that are shaped both by features of their abiotic landscape and by
   biotic constraints imposed by their coassociation. The Baja California
   peninsula provides an excellent opportunity to examine the influence of
   abiotic vs. biotic factors on patterns of diversity in plant-insect
   species. This is because past climatic and geological changes impacted
   the genetic structure of plants quite differently to that of
   codistributed free-living animals (e.g. herpetofauna and small mammals).
   Thus, plant-like' patterns should be discernible in host-specific insect
   herbivores. Here, we investigate the population history of a monophagous
   bark beetle, Araptus attenuatus, and consider drivers of
   phylogeographical patterns in the light of previous work on its host
   plant, Euphorbia lomelii. Using a combination of phylogenetic,
   coalescent-simulation-based and exploratory analyses of mitochondrial
   DNA sequences and nuclear genotypic data, we found that the evolutionary
   history of A.attenuatus exhibits similarities to its host plant that are
   attributable to both biotic and abiotic processes. Southward range
   expansion and recent colonization of continental Sonora from the Baja
   peninsula appear to be unique to this taxon pair and probably reflect
   influences of the host plant. On the other hand, abiotic factors with
   landscape-level influences on a diverse suite of codistributed
   arid-adapted taxa, such as Plio- and Pleistocene-aged marine incursions
   in the region, also left genetic signatures in beetle and host plant
   populations. Superimposed on these similarities, bark beetle-specific
   patterns and processes were also evident: our data revealed two
   secondarily sympatric, reproductively isolated genetic lineages, as well
   as a previously unrecognized mid-peninsular warm desert refuge. Taken
   together, this work illustrates that the evolutionary history of
   species-specific insect herbivores may represent a mosaic of influences,
   includingbut not limited tothose imposed by the host plant.},

Abstract = {Whether they are used to describe fitness, genome architecture or the
   spatial distribution of environmental variables, the concept of a
   landscape has figured prominently in our collective reasoning. The
   tradition of landscapes in evolutionary biology is one of fitness mapped
   onto axes defined by phenotypes or molecular sequence states. The
   characteristics of these landscapes depend on natural selection, which
   is structured across both genomic and environmental landscapes, and
   thus, the bridge among differing uses of the landscape concept (i.e.
   metaphorically or literally) is that of an adaptive phenotype and its
   distribution across geographical landscapes in relation to selective
   pressures. One of the ultimate goals of evolutionary biology should thus
   be to construct fitness landscapes in geographical space. Natural plant
   populations are ideal systems with which to explore the feasibility of
   attaining this goal, because much is known about the quantitative
   genetic architecture of complex traits for many different plant species.
   What is less known are the molecular components of this architecture. In
   this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman (2012) pioneer one of the
   first truly genome-wide association studies in a tree that moves us
   closer to this form of mechanistic understanding for an adaptive
   phenotype in natural populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
   Dougl. ex Loud.).},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and landscape topology may influence the genetic
   structure and connectivity between natural populations. Six
   microsatellite loci were used to infer the population structure of 35
   populations (N = 788) of the alpine Arabian burnet moth Reissita simonyi
   (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae) in Yemen and Oman. Due to the patchy
   distribution of larval food plants, R. simonyi is not continuously
   distributed throughout the studied area and the two recognized
   subspecies of this endemic species (Reissita s. simonyi/R. s.
   yemenicola) are apparently discretely distributed. All microsatellites
   showed prevalence of null alleles and therefore a thorough investigation
   of the impact of null alleles on different population genetic parameters
   (F-ST, inbreeding coefficients, and Population Graph topologies) is
   given. In general, null alleles reduced genetic covariance and
   independence of allele frequencies resulting in a more connected genetic
   topology in Population Graphs and an overestimation of pairwise F-ST
   values and inbreeding coefficients. Despite the presence of null
   alleles, Population Graphs also showed a much higher genetic
   connectivity within subspecies (and lower genetic differentiation (via
   F-ST)) than between; supporting existing taxonomic distinction. Partial
   Mantel tests showed that both geographical distance and altitude were
   highly correlated with the observed distribution of genetic structure
   within R. simonyi. In conclusion, we identified geographical and
   altitudinal distances in R. simonyi as well as an intervening desert
   area to be the main factors for spatial genetic structure in this
   species and show that the taxonomic division into two subspecies is
   confirmed by genetic analysis.},

Abstract = {The manner by which pollinators move across a landscape and their
   resulting preferences and/or avoidances of travel through particular
   habitat types can have a significant impact on plant population genetic
   structure and population-level connectivity. We examined the spatial
   genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae)
   adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two
   mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic
   covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident
   adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively
   autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of
   restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small
   (s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) =
   0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open
   canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced
   by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial
   distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was
   quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a
   network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance.
   The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive
   relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through
   C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy
   (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy),
   and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species
   cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within
   stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations
   are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and
   quality of intervening canopy cover.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Patterns of spatial genetic structure produced following the expansion
   of an invasive species into novel habitats reflect demographic processes
   that have shaped the genetic structure we see today. We examined 359
   individuals from 23 populations over 370 km within the James River Basin
   of Virginia, USA as well as four populations outside of the basin.
   Population diversity levels and genetic structure was quantified using
   several analyses. Within the James River Basin there was evidence for
   three separate introductions and a zone of secondary contact between two
   distinct lineages suggesting a relatively recent expansion within the
   basin. Microstegium vimineum possesses a mixed-mating system
   advantageous to invasion and populations with low diversity were found
   suggesting a recent founder event and self-fertilization. However,
   surprisingly high levels of diversity were found in some populations
   suggesting that out-crossing does occur. Understanding how invasive
   species spread and the genetic consequences following expansion may
   provide insights into the cause of invasiveness and can ultimately lead
   to better management strategies for control and eradication.},

Abstract = {Landscape genetics is a burgeoning field of interest that focuses on how
   site-specific factors influence the distribution of genetic variation
   and the genetic connectivity of individuals and populations. In this
   manuscript, we focus on two methodological extensions for landscape
   genetic analyses: the use of conditional genetic distance (cGD) derived
   from population networks and the utility of extracting potentially
   confounding effects caused by correlations between phylogeographic
   history and contemporary ecological factors. Individual-based
   simulations show that when describing the spatial distribution of
   genetic variation, cGD consistently outperforms the traditional genetic
   distance measure of linearized F(ST) under both 1- and 2-dimensional
   stepping stone models and Cavalli-Sforza and Edward's chord distance
   D(c) in 1-dimensional landscapes. To show how to identify and extract
   the effects of phylogeographic history prior to embarking on landscape
   genetic analyses, we use nuclear genotypic data from the Sonoran desert
   succulent Euphorbia lomelii (Euphrobiaceae), for which a detailed
   phylogeographic history has previously been determined. For E. lomelii,
   removing the effect of phylogeographic history significantly influences
   our ability to infer both the identity and the relative importance of
   spatial and bio-climatic variables in subsequent landscape genetic
   analyses. We close by discussing the utility of cGD in landscape genetic
   analyses.},

Title = {Nuclear gene phylogeography using PHASE: dealing with unresolved
   genotypes, lost alleles, and systematic bias in parameter estimation},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Background: A widely-used approach for screening nuclear DNA markers is
   to obtain sequence data and use bioinformatic algorithms to estimate
   which two alleles are present in heterozygous individuals. It is common
   practice to omit unresolved genotypes from downstream analyses, but the
   implications of this have not been investigated. We evaluated the
   haplotype reconstruction method implemented by PHASE in the context of
   phylogeographic applications. Empirical sequence datasets from five
   non-coding nuclear loci with gametic phase ascribed by molecular
   approaches were coupled with simulated datasets to investigate three key
   issues: (1) haplotype reconstruction error rates and the nature of
   inference errors, (2) dataset features and genotypic configurations that
   drive haplotype reconstruction uncertainty, and (3) impacts of omitting
   unresolved genotypes on levels of observed phylogenetic diversity and
   the accuracy of downstream phylogeographic analyses.
   Results: We found that PHASE usually had very low false-positives (i.e.,
   a low rate of confidently inferring haplotype pairs that were
   incorrect). The majority of genotypes that could not be resolved with
   high confidence included an allele occurring only once in a dataset, and
   genotypic configurations involving two low-frequency alleles were
   disproportionately represented in the pool of unresolved genotypes. The
   standard practice of omitting unresolved genotypes from downstream
   analyses can lead to considerable reductions in overall phylogenetic
   diversity that is skewed towards the loss of alleles with
   larger-than-average pairwise sequence divergences, and in turn, this
   causes systematic bias in estimates of important population genetic
   parameters.
   Conclusions: A combination of experimental and computational approaches
   for resolving phase of segregating sites in phylogeographic applications
   is essential. We outline practical approaches to mitigating potential
   impacts of computational haplotype reconstruction on phylogeographic
   inferences. With targeted application of laboratory procedures that
   enable unambiguous phase determination via physical isolation of alleles
   from diploid PCR products, relatively little investment of time and
   effort is needed to overcome the observed biases.},

   Hardy-Weinberg or linkage equilibrium across both of the two populations
   examined, consistent with Mendelian inheritance patterns.},

Title = {Not just vicariance: phylogeography of a Sonoran Desert euphorb
   indicates a major role of range expansion along the Baja peninsula},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {To examine the generality of population-level impacts of ancient
   vicariance identified for numerous arid-adapted animal taxa along the
   Baja peninsula, we tested phylogeographical hypotheses in a similarly
   distributed desert plant, Euphorbia lomelii (Euphorbiaceae). In light of
   fossil data indicating marked changes in the distributions of Baja
   floristic assemblages throughout the Holocene and earlier, we also
   examined evidence for range expansion over more recent temporal scales.
   Two classes of complementary analytical approaches - hypothesis-testing
   and hypothesis-generating - were used to exploit phylogeographical
   signal from chloroplast DNA sequence data and genotypic data from six
   codominant nuclear intron markers. Sequence data are consistent with a
   scenario of mid-peninsular vicariance originating c. 1 million years ago
   (Ma). Alternative vicariance scenarios representing earlier splitting
   events inferred for some animals (e.g. Isthmus of La Paz inundation, c.
   3 Ma; Sea of Cortez formation, c. 5 Ma) were rejected. Nested clade
   phylo-geographical analysis corroborated coalescent simulation-based
   inferences. Nuclear markers broadened the temporal spectrum over which
   phylogeographical scenarios could be addressed, and provided strong
   evidence for recent range expansions along the north-south axis of the
   Baja peninsula. In contrast to previous plant studies in this region,
   however, the expansions do not appear to have been in a strictly
   northward direction. These findings contribute to a growing appreciation
   of the complexity of organismal responses to past climatic and
   geological changes - even when taxa have evolved in the same landscape
   context.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This manuscript explores the simultaneous evolution of population
   genetic parameters and topological features within a population graph
   through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. I show that node centrality
   and graph breadth are significantly correlated to population genetic
   parameters Phi(ST) and M (p = -0.95; p = -0.98, respectively), which are
   commonly used in quantifying among population genetic structure and
   isolation by distance. Next, the topological consequences of migration
   patterns are examined by contrasting N-island and stepping stone models
   of gene movement. Finally, I show how variation in migration rate
   influences the rate of formation of specific topological features with
   particular emphasis to the phase transition that occurs when populations
   begin to become fixed due to restricted movement of genes among
   populations. I close by discussing the utility of this method for the
   analysis of intraspecific genetic variation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Pollen movement plays a critical role in the distribution of genetic
   variation within and among plant populations. Direct measures of pollen
   movement in the large, continuous populations that characterize many
   herbaceous plant species are often technically difficult and
   biologically unreliable. Here, we studied contemporary pollen movement
   in four large populations of Trillium cuneatum. Three populations,
   located in the Georgia Piedmont, are exposed to strong anthropogenic
   disturbances, while the fourth population, located in the Southern
   Appalachian Mountains, is relatively undisturbed. Using the recently
   developed TWOGENER analysis, we extracted estimates of the effective
   number of pollen donors (N-ep), effective mating neighbourhood size
   (A(ep)) and the average distance of pollen movement (delta) for each
   population. We extended the TWOGENER method by developing inference on
   the paternal gametic contribution to the embryo in situations where
   offspring genotypes are inferred from seeds and elaiosomes of species
   with bisporic megagametogenesis. Our estimates indicate that maternal
   plants do not sample pollen randomly from a global pool; rather, pollen
   movement in all four populations is highly restricted. Although the
   effective number of pollen donors per maternal plant is low (1.22-1.66)
   and pollen movement is highly localized in all populations, N-ep in the
   disturbed Piedmont populations is higher and there is more pollen
   movement than in the mountains. The distance pollen moves is greater in
   disturbed sites and fragmented populations, possibly due to edge effects
   in Trillium habitats.},

   variance and is accessible from http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu. These
   estimates are used to construct the test statistic, Phi(FT), whose
   significance is tested via permutation. The Phi(FT) statistic can
   subsequently be used to quantify genetic effective pollen donor
   population size (N-ep), effective mating area and dispersal distance.
   Furthermore, the GENER program can calculate Phi(FT) values for all
   pairs of substrata within the data set.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic landscape change can disrupt gene flow. As part of the
   Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, this study examined whether
   silvicultural practices influence pollen-mediated gene movement in the
   insect-pollinated species, Cornus florida L., by comparing pollen pool
   structure (Phi(st)) among clear-cutting, selective cutting, and uncut
   regimes with the expectation that pollen movement should be least in the
   uncut regime. Using a sample of 1500 seedlings - 10 each from 150 seed
   parents (43 in clear-cut, 74 in selective, and 33 in control sites) from
   six sites (each ranging from 266 to 527 ha), eight allozyme loci were
   analyzed with a pollen pool structure approach known as TWOGENER (Smouse
   et al., 2001; Evolution 55: 260-271). This analysis revealed that pollen
   pool structure was less in clear-cut ((Phi) over circle (C) = 0.090, P <
   0.001) than in uncut areas ((Phi) over cap (U) = 0.174, P < 0.001), with
   selective-cut intermediate ((Phi) over circles = 0.125, P < 0.001).
   These estimates translate into more effective pollen donors (N(ep)) in
   clear-cut (N(ep) = 5.56) and selective-cut (N(ep) = 4.00) areas than in
   uncut areas (N(ep) = 2.87). We demonstrate that Phi(C) less than or
   equal to Phi(S) less than or equal to Phi(U), with (Phi) over circle
   (C), significantly smaller than (Phi) over circle (U) (P < 0.034). The
   findings imply that, as long as a sufficiently large number of seed
   parents remain to provide adequate reproduction and to avoid a genetic
   bottleneck in the effective number of mothers, silvicultural management
   may not negatively affect the effective number of pollen parents, and
   hence subsequent genetic diversity in Cornus florida.},

Abstract = {Patterns of intraspecific genetic variation result from interactions
   among both historical and contemporary evolutionary processes.
   Traditionally, population geneticists have used methods such as
   F-statistics, pairwise isolation by distance models, spatial
   autocorrelation and coalescent models to analyse this variation and to
   gain insight about causal evolutionary processes. Here we introduce a
   novel approach (Population Graphs) that focuses on the analysis of
   marker-based population genetic data within a graph theoretic framework.
   This method can be used to estimate traditional population genetic
   summary statistics, but its primary focus is on characterizing the
   complex topology resulting from historical and contemporary genetic
   interactions among populations. We introduce the application of
   Population Graphs by examining the range-wide population genetic
   structure of a Sonoran Desert cactus (Lophocereus schottii). With this
   data set, we evaluate hypotheses regarding historical vicariance,
   isolation by distance, population-level assignment and the importance of
   specific populations to species-wide genetic connectivity. We close by
   discussing the applicability of Population Graphs for addressing a wide
   range of population genetic and phylogeographical problems.},

Abstract = {Patterns of pollen dispersal are central to both the ecology and
   evolution of plant populations. However, the mechanisms controlling
   either the dispersal process itself or our estimation of that process
   may be influenced by site-specific factors such as local forest
   structure and nonuniform adult genetic structure. Here, we present an
   extension of the AMOVA model applied to the recently developed TWOGENER
   analysis of pollen pool structure. This model, dubbed the Stepwise AMOVA
   (StAMOVA), focuses on determining to what extent ecological,
   demographic, and/or environmental factors influence the observed genetic
   variation in spatially separated pollen pools. The analysis is verified
   for efficacy, using an extensive battery of simulations, illustrating: (
   1) how nonuniform adult genetic structure influences the differentiation
   of spatially separated pollen pools, and ( 2) how effectively the
   Stepwise analysis performs in carrying out the appropriate corrections.
   Finally, the model is applied to a Quercus alba data set, from which we
   have prior evidence that the adult genetic structure is nonuniformly
   distributed across the sampling landscape. From this data set, we show
   how the Stepwise model can be applied to remove the effects of spatial
   adult genetic structure on pollen pool differentiation and contrast
   these results with those derived from the original TWOGENER analysis.},

Abstract = {The fragmented populations and reduced population densities that result
   from human disturbance are issues of growing importance in evolutionary
   and conservation biology. A key issue is whether remnant individuals
   become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata )
   is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly
   jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied
   pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick
   Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen
   donors (N (ep) ) and average distance of effective pollen movement
   (delta). Using twogener, our recently developed hybrid model of
   paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and
   progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current N (ep) = 3.68
   individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we
   assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen
   dispersal distance (delta) and estimated delta= 64.8 m. We then deployed
   our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick
   population to evaluate the extent to which N (ep) may have changed, as a
   consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999.
   Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate N
   (ep) was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both
   estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for
   wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results
   presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling
   pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic
   attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak
   resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic
   isolation.},

Abstract = {While floral herbivores and predispersal seed predators often reduce
   plant reproductive output, their role in limiting plant fitness and
   population growth is less clear, especially for iteroparous perennial
   plant species. In this study we experimentally excluded floral
   herbivores and predispersal seed predators (insecticide spray versus
   water control) over a 2-year period to examine the effect of
   inflorescence-feeding insects on levels of seed production, seedling
   emergence, and juvenile establishment for Liatris cylindracea, an
   iteroparous perennial plant. In addition, we collected detailed
   demographic data on all life stage transitions for an additional set of
   individuals in the same population over 4 years. We used the
   experimental and demographic data to construct stochastic
   individual-based simulations to evaluate the overall effect of
   inflorescence-feeding insects on adult recruitment per maternal plant (a
   fitness component) and population growth rate. The insect exclusion
   experiments showed that damage due to insects decreased seed production,
   seedling emergence, and juvenile establishment for both years'
   experiments. These results indicate that recruitment was seed-limited
   through juvenile establishment, and that inflorescence-feeding insects
   influenced the degree of seed limitation. Results of the
   individual-based simulation models, which included individual
   demographic and temporal stochasticity, showed that
   inflorescence-feeding insects negatively affected the number of adult
   offspring per maternal plant recruited into the population and
   population growth rate for both years' experiments. Taken together, the
   results of the experimental exclusions and the individual-based models
   indicate that inflorescence-feeding insects can influence population
   growth rate, and have the potential to act as a selective force for the
   evolution of traits in this plant species.},

Abstract = {Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of
   genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system,
   which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and
   outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to
   the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest
   management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest
   management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem
   Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering
   dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant
   and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In
   1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida
   individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar
   to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management
   treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the
   management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study
   trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because
   differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental
   factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on
   a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the
   rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective
   number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the
   hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence
   on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among
   mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest
   treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single
   locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective
   number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management
   treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with
   local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local
   familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating
   was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show
   that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on
   insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could
   be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator
   behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on
   gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as
   management treatments are continued and further studies on additional
   plant species.},

Abstract = {Pollen is the dominant vector of gamete exchange for most temperate tree
   species. Because pollen movement influences the creation, maintenance
   and erosion of genetic structure in adult populations, it is important
   to understand what factors influence the process of pollen movement.
   Isolation by distance in pollen donor populations can create highly
   structured pollen polls by increased sampling of local fathers.
   Extrinsic factors, such as the intervening vegetative structure and
   local pollen donor densities, can also influence the genetic composition
   of local. pollen pools. Using paternally inherited chloroplast
   microsatellite markers, we examined the structure and diversity of
   pollen pools in Pinus echinata Mill. in southern Missouri, USA. Our
   analysis is based on a multivariate AMOVA analysis of stands
   (approximate to1 ha; six per region) nested within regions (approximate
   to 800 ha; four each). Significant multilocus structure of the pollen
   pool within regions (phi (SR) = 0.095), but not among regions (phi (RT)
   = 0.010), indicates that pollen movement is relatively restricted.
   Furthermore, the significant correlation between pairwise genetic and
   physical distances (Mantel correlation; rho = 0.32) provided support for
   the isolation by distance hypothesis. Our results indicated that
   availability of pollen donors did not affect diversity of the pollen
   pool, measured by the number of unique multilocus genotypes at each
   stand. However, pollen pool diversity was negatively associated with
   vegetative structure, measured as total forest tree density. Our
   findings indicated that on-going pollen movement within continuous
   forest is relatively restricted as a result of both isolation by
   distance and vegetative structure.},

Abstract = {Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially
   distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in
   microevolutionary processes and conservation biologists interested in
   the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real
   time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation
   (parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener)
   that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools
   sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate
   mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we
   describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate
   intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine
   whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling
   considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by
   simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in
   male gametes can be estimated by Phi (FT), a male gametic analogue of
   Wright's F(ST) and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We
   illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically
   or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level
   of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous
   case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic
   resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus
   alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Phi (FT) = 0.06,
   translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an
   effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m.
   Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously
   realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This
   case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey
   and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about
   landscape-level gene movements.},
